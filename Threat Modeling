Threat Modeling Connect about an intranet web
 
Considering an example of an intranet web project [https://github.com/Hickathon2023/Hickathon] aimed at providing absence days management for an office environment. We'll walk through the steps of connecting threat modeling and design to evaluate the project.
 
1. Identify the Project Scope:
   - Target Environment: Office
   - Project Objective: Develop an intranet web application for managing absence days efficiently and accurately.
 
2. Conduct a Threat Modeling Exercise:
   a. Identify Assets:
      - Employee data (personal information, attendance records)
      - System infrastructure (servers, databases, network)
      - Confidential company information
 
   b. Identify Threats:
      - Unauthorized access to the absence management system
      - Insider attacks or misuse of privileges
      - Data breaches compromising employee information
      - Service interruptions or system failures
 
   c. Assess Vulnerabilities:
      - Weak authentication mechanisms (e.g., weak passwords or lack of multi-factor authentication)
      - Insecure data storage or transmission
      - Insufficient access controls and permissions
      - Lack of system monitoring and auditing
 
   d. Rate Risks:
      - Evaluate the impact and likelihood of each identified threat and vulnerability combination to prioritize them for mitigation. For example, unauthorized access to employee data may have a medium impact and high likelihood, while a data breach could have a high impact and low likelihood.
 
3. Develop Countermeasures and Mitigation Strategies:
   a. Design Security Controls:
      - Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as password policies and multi-factor authentication.
      - Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.
      - Apply access controls and permissions based on the principle of least privilege.
      - Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems to monitor and mitigate potential attacks.
      - Regularly update and patch software components to address known vulnerabilities.
 
   b. Implement Secure Design Principles:
      - Employ secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
      - Separate user roles and responsibilities to enforce access control and segregation of duties.
      - Implement secure session management to prevent session hijacking or fixation attacks.
      - Employ secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to protect data during transmission.
      - Conduct regular security awareness training for employees to promote good security practices.
 
   c. Establish Incident Response Plan:
      - Develop a detailed plan outlining the steps to be taken in case of a security incident, including incident reporting, containment, eradication, and recovery procedures.
      - Assign roles and responsibilities within the incident response team.
      - Regularly test and update the incident response plan to ensure its effectiveness.
 
4. Evaluate the Design:
   a. Review System Architecture:
      - Assess the overall architecture of the intranet web application, including server infrastructure, network components, and databases.
      - Identify potential design flaws, scalability issues, and compatibility with existing systems.
 
   b. Conduct Penetration Testing:
      - Engage security professionals to conduct penetration tests on the intranet web application.
      - Identify vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors, such as input validation issues or insecure configurations.
      - Verify the effectiveness of security controls and identify any weaknesses in the system.
 
   c. Test Usability and User Experience:
      - Conduct user testing to evaluate the system's usability, intuitiveness, and efficiency in managing absence days.
      - Gather feedback from users to address any usability issues and improve the overall user experience.
 
5. Iterate and Improve:
   a. Gather Feedback:
      - Collect feedback from employees, HR personnel, and security experts regarding the system's functionality, security, and user experience.
      - Encourage users to report any security incidents or vulnerabilities they encounter.
 
   b. Incorporate Lessons Learned:
      - Analyze the feedback received and identify areas of improvement.
      - Address any reported security vulnerabilities or usability issues.
